# /etc/network/interfaces -- configuration file for ifup(8), ifdown(8)

# Interfaces file for Nao robot for SPL Robocup 2009 Competition,
# For team Burst, number 4.
# We were given the C network 192.168.4.0, and used
# netmask 255.255.255.255 during the game (actually, we had to run
# our own gamecontroller with broadcast 192.168.4.255, but that's
# probably routing rules?)

# 

# To configure a new robot:
# Copy this file to /etc/network/interfaces
# update the ip number last quad, here 12, to whatever you want.
#  - please use the robot last 3 digits serial number, if <250
# You also need to copy the wpa_supplicant.conf file into /etc/

# To change a field, you need to change the essid in both interfaces
# and wpa_supplicant.conf to SPL_FIELD_A or B or C or D, as appropriate.
